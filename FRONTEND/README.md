# College Appointment System - Frontend (Scaffold)

This folder contains a Vite + React + Tailwind + GSAP frontend scaffold.

Quick start:

```bash
cd FRONTEND
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set the backend URL in `.env` or `VITE_API_URL` environment variable (default `http://localhost:5000/api`).

I'll implement the full components and pages (auth, appointments, availability, animations) after you confirm the scaffold is ready.
